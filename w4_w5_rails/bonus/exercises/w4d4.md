# Questions for w4d4

Answer these after you finished the readings.

## Topic 1: HTML Form Basics
0. Without using form helpers/builders/tags, complete (in raw HTML) the following form:

```html
<form action="http://mycoolsite.com/submitstuff" method="post">
  <!-- entire form is for a model named 'contract' -->
  <!-- replace the comments below to complete the form: -->

  <!-- label for attribute 'first_name' -->
  <!-- text field for attribute 'first_name' -->
  <!-- label for attribute 'last_name' -->
  <!-- text field for attribute 'last_name' -->
  <br>
  <!-- label for attribute 'social_security_number' -->
  <!-- text field for attribute 'social_security_number' -->
  <br>
  <!-- label for attribute 'bio' -->
  <!-- textarea for attribute 'bio' -->

  How much money do you have?<br>
  <!-- select field for attribute 'net_worth' -->
  <!-- options are: "not much", "a bit", "average", "a ton" -->

  Agree to give away identity to scammer?<br>
  <!-- label and radio button for attribute 'agree' -->
  <!-- values and label should read "true" and "false" -->

  <!-- submit button, text is: 'Get scammed' -->
</form>
```

## Topic 2: Rails Form Basics
0. Repeat question 1 from Topic 1, but this time use `form_for` and using the builder methods. Skip the select field for now.

0. Add to it:
  0. A password field
  0. A date select field
  0. A hidden field

0. Right now, the controller below does not handle errors in the form. Fix it, and be sure that the re-rendered form is pre-populated.

  ```ruby
  class MindController < ApplicationController
    # ...
    def create
      @peon = Peon.create(params[:peon])
      redirect_to peon_url(@peon)
    end
  end
  ```

## Topic 3: Collections and Hidden Fields

0. Let's play with `select`.
  0. Using form_builder, write code that would generate a select field for attribute `shoes` with the following options: 'small', 'medium', 'large'.

  0. Using form_builder, write code that would generate a select field for attribute `the_devil` with the options being a list of users in the database. The model for users is `User`. Do this with `collection_select`.

0. Use a form_builder method to create a hidden field for the attribute "shadow". What would you need to add in the controller to make this work?

## Topic 4: Mass Assignment

0. Explain mass assignment. Are attributes blacklisted or whitelisted to start? How do you whitelist an attribute?
